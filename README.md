# Map Maker

## A tool for quickly prototyping/designing maps

This project is the tool I use to work on my personal projects that require map design (basically just game dev). Making it open source as I'm too busy to add the final finishing touches to make it user-friendly but I wanted to share the grid logic that I used so that others might finish it. Even though the last touches aren't added it still is feature complete with the following:

* Diffrent Sized Maps
* Biomes
* Icons For Selected Rooms
* Doors
* Name Selected Rooms
* White/Dark Mode
* Save Maps

While I may come back and finish this I'm still very happy with what I made and what I learned while developing it.
